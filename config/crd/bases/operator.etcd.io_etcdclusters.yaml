              currentReplicas:
                description: |-
                  CurrentReplicas is the number of etcd pods managed by the StatefulSet for this cluster.
                  This reflects the .spec.replicas of the underlying StatefulSet.

              currentVersion:
                description: |-
                  CurrentVersion is the observed etcd version of the cluster.
                  This is typically derived from the version of the healthy leader or a consensus among healthy members.

                description: LeaderId is the hex-encoded ID of the current etcd cluster

              memberCount:
                description: |-
                  MemberCount is the number of members currently registered in the etcd cluster,
                  as reported by the etcd 'member list' API. This may differ from CurrentReplicas
                  during scaling operations or if members are added/removed outside the operator's direct control.

              members:
                description: |-
                  Members provides the status of each individual etcd member.
                  Alternative listMapKey could be 'name' if 'id' is not always immediately available or stable during init.
                  However, 'id' is more canonical once a member is part of the cluster.
                items:
                  description: MemberStatus defines the observed state of a single
                    etcd member.

                    id:
                      description: |-
                        ID is the hex-encoded member ID as reported by etcd.
                        This is the canonical identifier for an etcd member.

                      description: |-
                        IsHealthy indicates if the member is considered healthy.
                        A member is healthy if its etcd /health endpoint is reachable and reports OK,
                        and its Status endpoint does not report any 'Errors'.

                        This can also be the name reported by etcd itself if set.
